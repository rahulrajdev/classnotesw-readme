Coding notes
CSS grid system in bootstrap

Sketches
  matching things to a grid
  headers, sections are all tied together in space, and its all about how those things are tied together in space
  be mindful of the grid
  can get structure of the html by just visualing it in your head based on the sketches/grid
  - grids serve to align elements aesthetically
     - bootstrap uses grid of 12 columns across the screen 
     - bases the size of the columns on the size of the screen 
     - do not have to worry about exact amount of pixels, just out of 12 
     - grids make it easy to have content (text, images, regions) align aesthetically 
     - think about the grids before you design, can visualize it and then make it 
     - if things are laid out on a grid, increases usability of website 
     - tools for sketch/grid creation 
      - slacked out 
  - Rows and columns
      - all containers that fit within the grid (rows and columns) 
      - easiest way to start is containers in bootstrap 
          - like a skeleton
          
 REVIEW - CSS positioning, 
 
 Boostrap Grid
    - lets you organize content based on the number of the columns a div spans out of total of 12 columns
    <div class="col-md-12"> (spans full width)
    <div class="col-md-4"> (spans 1/3 of the page)
    - every bootstrap grid is made up of containers, rows, columns
        - containers wrap around the entire grid
